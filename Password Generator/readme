Hello Friends, most of the accounts require strong password and we couldn't generate a strong password using alphabets, number and characters so our password 
sometimes is vulnerable, so, today we'll generate a strong password using python.

In this code we asks user their name and gender, respective to them we display their name and Password.
For Password, we hardcoded the size of the password but you can alter the size of Passowrd on your own.
We give lower alphabets, we stored them in lower variable and then for upper case we converted lower into upper by .upper and stored them in upper variable.
We give numbers and store them in number variable.
We give some special characters and store them in characters variable.
We added lower, upper, numbers and characters in a cariable named sum.
We join them and randomize them using random.sample and store them in password variable.
WE print password and it displays strong Password.
